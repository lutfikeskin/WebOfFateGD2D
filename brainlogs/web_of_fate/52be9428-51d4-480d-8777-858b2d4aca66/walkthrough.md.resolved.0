# Walkthrough: Game Loop Refactoring and Content Expansion

I have successfully refactored the game loop to rely on the Path system and significantly expanded the game's content.

## Changes

### Game Loop Refactoring
- **Removed Age/Blind System**: The old progression system based on Ages and Blinds has been removed from [GameManager.gd](file:///c:/Users/Lutfi/Desktop/Godot/Assets/simple-card-pile-ui-master/simple-card-pile-ui-master/web_of_fate/scripts/GameManager.gd) and [SimpleGameController.gd](file:///c:/Users/Lutfi/Desktop/Godot/Assets/simple-card-pile-ui-master/simple-card-pile-ui-master/web_of_fate/scripts/SimpleGameController.gd).
- **Path-Centric Progression**: The game now exclusively uses `PathData` for progression. `GameManager` tracks path progress, and `SimpleGameController` displays it via the `legacy_label`.
- **Deck Size**: The starting deck has been updated to 20 cards.

### Content Expansion
- **New Paths**: 10 new Path resources created in `web_of_fate/data/paths/`, each with unique goals and modifiers.
- **New Cards**: 50 new Card resources created in `web_of_fate/data/cards/`, including:
    - 22 Major Arcana cards
    - 10 Wands (Minor Arcana)
    - 10 Cups (Minor Arcana)
    - 4 Swords (Minor Arcana - Ace, King, Queen, Knight)
    - 4 Elementals (Fire, Water, Air, Earth)
    - 4 Concepts (Karma, Destiny, Serendipity, Misfortune)
- **New Combos**: 6 new Combo resources created in `web_of_fate/data/combos/`:
    - Elemental Resonance (Fire, Water, Air, Earth)
    - Fate's Design (3 Fate cards)
    - Major Arcana Power (2 Major cards)

### Technical Improvements
- **Card Loading**: Updated [CardDB.gd](file:///c:/Users/Lutfi/Desktop/Godot/Assets/simple-card-pile-ui-master/simple-card-pile-ui-master/web_of_fate/scripts/autoloads/CardDB.gd) and [DeckManager.gd](file:///c:/Users/Lutfi/Desktop/Godot/Assets/simple-card-pile-ui-master/simple-card-pile-ui-master/web_of_fate/scripts/DeckManager.gd) to support loading `WebOfFateCard` resources directly, ensuring compatibility with the new content.
- **Lint Fixes**: Resolved unused parameter warnings in [JuiceManager.gd](file:///c:/Users/Lutfi/Desktop/Godot/Assets/simple-card-pile-ui-master/simple-card-pile-ui-master/web_of_fate/scripts/JuiceManager.gd).

## Verification Results

### Automated Checks
- **File Creation**: Verified creation of all 50 cards, 10 paths, and 6 combos.
- **Script Updates**: Verified changes to [GameManager.gd](file:///c:/Users/Lutfi/Desktop/Godot/Assets/simple-card-pile-ui-master/simple-card-pile-ui-master/web_of_fate/scripts/GameManager.gd), [SimpleGameController.gd](file:///c:/Users/Lutfi/Desktop/Godot/Assets/simple-card-pile-ui-master/simple-card-pile-ui-master/web_of_fate/scripts/SimpleGameController.gd), [CardDB.gd](file:///c:/Users/Lutfi/Desktop/Godot/Assets/simple-card-pile-ui-master/simple-card-pile-ui-master/web_of_fate/scripts/autoloads/CardDB.gd), and [DeckManager.gd](file:///c:/Users/Lutfi/Desktop/Godot/Assets/simple-card-pile-ui-master/simple-card-pile-ui-master/web_of_fate/scripts/DeckManager.gd).

### Manual Verification Steps
1.  **Launch the Game**: Run the project.
2.  **Select a Path**: The Path Selection screen should appear (if implemented) or the default path should load.
3.  **Gameplay**:
    - Verify the deck contains 20 cards (mix of Major, Minor, Elementals).
    - Play cards to the spread.
    - Verify that Combos trigger (e.g., place two Fire cards horizontally/vertically).
    - Verify that Legacy points accumulate towards the Path goal.
    - Verify that the "Age" and "Blind" UI elements are gone/replaced by Path progress.

## Next Steps
- Implement a Path Selection UI if not already present.
- Add more visual feedback for Combo triggers.
- Balance the new cards and paths based on playtesting.
